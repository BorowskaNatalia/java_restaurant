The restaurant receives orders both from stationary customers and orders received via the portal marked as orders with the delivery option. Each order has a certain number of items ordered from the restaurant menu. The restaurant menu consists of items, each of which is represented by its unique number, name, short description of the dish and price. Stationary orders should have information about the table number, while remote orders should have information about the delivery address. In addition, each order has its own unique number, consistent with the order, i.e. the second order in a given day should have the number 2 and the hour and minutes at which it was placed.
